# INDIA-RISC-V-SoC-tapeout-program

RISC-V VSD Participants India

This repository documents my week-by-week progress with tasks inside each week.

"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem

Week 0 — Setup & Tools
Task	Description	Status
Task 0	 Tools Installation — Installed Iverilog, Yosys, and gtkWave	✅ Done Key Learnings from Week 0
Installed and verified open-source EDA tools successfully.
Learned about basic environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.
Prepared the system for upcoming RTL → GDSII flow experiments.
 Acknowledgment:
I am thankful to Kunal Ghosh and Team VLSI System Design (VSD) for the opportunity to participate in the ongoing RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.
