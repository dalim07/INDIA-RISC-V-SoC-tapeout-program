üáÆüá≥ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program - Week 1: Day 1
This repository documents the progress made during the India RISC-V SoC Tapeout Workshop, focusing on the foundational tasks for Week 1, Day 1.

üöÄ Day 1 Progress: Introduction to the Digital Flow
The primary focus of Day 1 was to introduce the essential open-source EDA tools and run a simple design through the standard digital design flow: Simulation, Verification, and Synthesis.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
Tool	Purpose
Icarus Verilog (iVerilog)	Used as the compiler and simulator to execute the Verilog HDL code and generate VCD (Value Change Dump) files for waveform analysis.
GTKWave	Used as the waveform viewer to visualize the signals (inputs, outputs, internal wires) from the VCD file generated by the simulation.
Yosys	Used as the synthesis tool to convert the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) Verilog code into a gate-level netlist, preparing the design for physical layout.

üíª Design Under Test (DUT)
2:1 Multiplexer (MUX)
The first circuit implemented and verified was a basic 2:1 Multiplexer.

Feature	Details
File Name	good_mux.v
Function	Selects one of two single-bit data inputs (A or B) based on a single-bit select signal (Sel).
Expected Logic	If Sel is '0', the output equals A. If Sel is '1', the output equals B.

Export to Sheets
Verification and Synthesis Flow
Simulation (iVerilog): Ran the good_mux.v file using a testbench to ensure the output matches the truth table for all input combinations.

Waveform Analysis (GTKWave): Visually confirmed that the output signal transitioned correctly based on the Sel signal in the generated VCD file.

Synthesis (Yosys): Successfully synthesized the good_mux.v file to generate a gate-level netlist (using basic logic gates like AND, OR, NOT), confirming the design is structurally sound and ready for the back-end flow.
